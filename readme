Calculatoure is a very slick, versatile and easy to use scientific calculator made with HTML5. Perform complex mathematical calculations including trigonometry, algebra, base conversion and bitwise operations. Works offline (as a Chrome app).

Build requirements:
makejs: http://www.github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/makejs/

API manual:
First, build it:
$ makejs
Then grab the calculatoure.api.(jgz or js, whichever you wish to serve, or both)
Use a script tag to include it.
Voila, you can use the api, try typing alert(calculatoure('2pi')) into your js console to see if it works.

CLI instructions:
First, build it and then install:
$Â makejs cli; cd cli; sudo makejs install; cd ..
And then you can use "calculatoure" in the bash to start the application. ctrl+c to quit.

 * Now supports base conversions 2-16 fully (see help(base))
 * Custom variables enabled (but you still can't break anything :] )
 * ans (or answer) now returns the latest answer and ans(x) returns x:th answer, very cool for recursion.
 * Better formula memory
 * More lenient syntax, e.g. you can type 2pi equals 2*pi, 256 2 also equals 256*2!
 * Support for degrees and turns (e.g. sin(190deg) )
 * Fixed a critical bug for decimals starting with a zero

2011/01/04: v. 0.991 (1.0RC1, r16)
 * New design to increase productivity, functionality and eyecandy.
